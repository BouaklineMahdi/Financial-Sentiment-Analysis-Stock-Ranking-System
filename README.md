# Financial-Sentiment-Analysis-Stock-Ranking-System
The Financial Sentiment Analysis & Stock Ranking System, also known as PriceProphet is a sophisticated machine learning project conducted in collaboration with a team, aimed at deciphering sentiment trends within financial news and social media data related to S&P 500 stocks. Leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model processes and analyzes textual information, extracting valuable insights regarding the sentiments associated with specific stocks. The system utilizes historical data from approximately a year ago to ensure a comprehensive understanding of past market sentiments. The applications of this system extend to providing investors and financial professionals with a real-time gauge of market sentiment, aiding in more informed decision-making. By transforming the model into an interactive website, we facilitated user access to dynamic stock rankings and sentiment analysis reports, enhancing their ability to navigate the financial landscape with greater confidence. This project encapsulates the fusion of machine learning, financial analytics, and user interface design, contributing to a powerful tool for those navigating the complexities of the stock market.
